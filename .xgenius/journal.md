## Session 1: Fresh Start — Phase 1 Baseline Submission

### What was done:
1. **Code fixes applied to PPO and PQN scripts:**
   - Fixed envpool config: episodic_life=True, reward_clip=True (community standard)
   - Fixed logging: aggregate multiple episodes at same global_step into single log entry (mean)
   - Added --hypothesis-id, --experiment-id, --output-dir CLI args
   - Added CSV output at end of training with robust metrics: mean_return, q4_return, auc, final_avg20

2. **Results bank created:**
   - results/experiments.csv (empty, ready for data)
   - results/hypotheses.csv (h001 PPO, h002 PQN)

3. **Submitted 90 baseline jobs (all 4 clusters: rorqual, narval, nibi, fir):**
   - h001 (PPO): 15 games × 3 seeds = 45 jobs, 40M env steps each
   - h002 (PQN): 15 games × 3 seeds = 45 jobs, 40M env steps each

### Games: Amidar, Alien, Breakout, Enduro, PrivateEye, Solaris, BattleZone, DoubleDunk, NameThisGame, Phoenix, Qbert, SpaceInvaders, MsPacman, Venture, MontezumaRevenge

### What to do next:
1. Wait for baseline jobs to complete
2. Parse CSV results from results/CLUSTER/ directories
3. Compute HNS using compute_hns.py for cross-game comparison
4. Populate results bank with all baseline data
5. Analyze which games each baseline struggles on — these are the targets for Phase 2
6. Begin Phase 2: formulate first hypotheses based on baseline analysis and literature review

### Context from previous research runs (memory):
- Previous runs showed PPO > PQN on HNS (mean 0.034 vs -0.181)
- Best PQN variant was h034 (Entropy-Adaptive + Regenerative) with 8W/2L/2F vs base PQN
- Key techniques to explore: NaP (weight projection), CHAIN (churn reduction), SPR (self-predictive), network sparsity
- PPO + entropy-adaptive was highest priority direction
- Must avoid the word 'eval' in xgenius commands (blocked by safety filter)
